Please study the
[Makefile](https://github.com/kaihendry/natalian/blob/mk/Makefile) for how this

# Why Go?

I could have written this in shell. #1 reason I chose golang is the convenience
of not having to worry about annoying Web encodings since
[html/template](http://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) takes care of that.
